# Python_practice_programs_v2.0

This repository contains a collection of Python programs designed to practice fundamental programming concepts such as user input, loops, conditionals, and basic operations. The programs are grouped into four batches, each covering different problem-solving techniques.  

## Features  
- âœ… Basic arithmetic and logical operations  
- âœ… Loop-based number processing  
- âœ… Sorting and filtering techniques  
- âœ… Duplicate and unique number identification  

Each program focuses on improving problem-solving skills while following Python coding best practices. ðŸš€

## Programs Included

- `check_equality.py` â€“ Checks if two input numbers are equal.  
- `compare_two_numbers.py` â€“ Asks the user for two numbers and prints the larger one.  
- `count_odd_numbers.py` â€“ Asks the user to input 10 numbers and counts how many are odd.  
- `exponentiation.py` â€“ Raises the first number to the power of the second number.  
- `print_even_numbers.py` â€“ Prints all even numbers from 0 to 100 using a for loop.  
- `product_of_two_numbers.py` â€“ Computes and prints the product of two numbers.  
- `quotient_with_decimal.py` â€“ Computes and prints the quotient of two numbers with decimal formatting.  
- `skip_numbers_ending_with_zero.py` â€“ Prints numbers from 0 to 100, skipping numbers ending in zero.  
- `sum_of_ten_numbers.py` â€“ Asks the user to input 10 numbers and prints their sum.  
- `sum_of_two_numbers.py` â€“ Computes and prints the sum of two numbers.  

### **Batch 2**  
- `check_inequality.py` â€“ Checks if two numbers are **not equal**.  
- `compare_two_numbers.py` â€“ Accepts two numbers and prints the larger one.  
- `count_even_numbers.py` â€“ Asks for **10 numbers** and counts how many are even.  
- `difference_of_two_numbers.py` â€“ Computes the **difference** between two numbers.  
- `find_the_remainder.py` â€“ Computes the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.  
- `first_input_subtract_remaining_numbers.py` â€“ The first number is subtracted by the sum of the next **9 numbers**.  
- `print_numbers_between_two_inputs.py` â€“ Displays all numbers between two user-inputted values.  
- `print_odd_numbers.py` â€“ Displays all odd numbers from **0 to 100** using a while loop.  
- `quotient_without_decimal.py` â€“ Divides two numbers and removes decimal places.  
- `skip_numbers_ending_0and5.py` â€“ Prints numbers from **0 to 100**, skipping those ending in 0 or 5.  

### **Batch 3**  
- `find_lowest_number.py` â€“ Asks the user for numbers until an invalid input is given and displays the lowest number entered.  
- `non_duplicate_numbers_finder.py` â€“ Asks the user to input 10 numbers and displays numbers that don't have duplicates.  
- `non_repeating_numbers.py` â€“ Asks the user to input 10 numbers and displays all numbers, showing only the first entry of duplicates.  
- `sort_numbers_ascending.py` â€“ Asks the user for numbers until an invalid input is given and displays the numbers sorted from lowest to highest.  
- `unique_number_checker.py` â€“ Asks the user for numbers until an invalid input is given, displaying whether each number is unique or a duplicate.  

### **Batch 4**  
- `compute_the_average.py` â€“ Asks the user for numbers until an invalid input is given and displays the average of the numbers.  
- `display_duplicate_numbers.py` â€“ Asks the user to input 10 numbers and displays numbers that have duplicates.  
- `display_highest_number.py` â€“ Asks the user for numbers until an invalid input is given and displays the highest number entered.  
- `find_most_duplicate_number.py` â€“ Asks the user for numbers until an invalid input is given and displays the number with the most duplicates.  
- `sort_numbers_descending_order.py` â€“ Asks the user for numbers until an invalid input is given and displays the numbers sorted from highest to lowest.  

## Notes  
- The programs focus on fundamental Python concepts, making them great for practice.
